# DevOps Fundamentals — Day 2

This document covers the importance of Linux fundamentals and shell scripting in the context of DevOps.

## Why Linux & Shell Scripting Matter

- **Linux is the dominant OS for production servers.**
- **DevOps work is primarily command-line driven**, making Linux proficiency essential.
- **Shell scripting automates repetitive tasks**, reducing human error.
- Widely used in **CI/CD pipelines** and **system automation**.

## Core Linux Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
