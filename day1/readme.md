# DevOps Fundamentals — Day 1

This document outlines the foundational concepts of DevOps and its role in modern software delivery.

## What DevOps Really Means

DevOps is a set of practices aimed at **reducing friction between development and operations teams** through:

- **Automation** – Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)** – Ensuring code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed reliably and frequently.
- **Continuous Testing** – Integrating automated tests to detect issues early in the development cycle.
- **Continuous Monitoring** – Observing applications and infrastructure in real-time to proactively address issues.

**Goal:** Faster, more reliable, and repeatable software releases.

## How Software Delivery Worked Before DevOps

- Development, testing, and operations worked in isolated silos.
- Deployments were largely manual.
- Release cycles often took 10–15 days or longer.
- High risk of errors, delays, and miscommunication.

## DevOps in the Context of SDLC

The traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes:


DevOps transforms this rigid sequence into a **continuous loop**, where:

- Feedback is incorporated rapidly
- Automation reduces manual work
- Monitoring ensures faster detection and resolution of issues

This approach enables faster, reliable, and iterative improvements in software delivery.

## Importance of Foundations

Understanding the **core principles of DevOps** is critical before diving into:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cloud infrastructure and tooling

DevOps is not just a set of tools—it is a mindset and culture focused on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.
