# DevOps Fundamentals — Day 4 (Networking Concepts)

This session focused on understanding **core networking concepts** essential for DevOps, including IP addresses, IPv4, CIDR, subnets, ports, and private vs. public networks.

## Project Overview

The session involved hands-on exercises and conceptual learning to simulate real-world network management scenarios:

- Understanding IP addressing and IPv4 basics  
- Calculating subnets and CIDR notation for efficient network allocation  
- Differentiating between private and public networks  
- Learning port numbers and their importance in service communication  
- Exploring network protocols like TCP and UDP  

This demonstrates the **real-world relevance of networking knowledge** in deploying, securing, and managing applications and infrastructure.

## Why Networking Matters in DevOps

- **Network configuration is critical** for application accessibility and security.  
- **Misconfigured networks lead to downtime or vulnerabilities**, impacting production systems.  
- **Subnetting and CIDR help in designing scalable, organized networks**.  
- **Ports and protocols** are essential for communication between services and troubleshooting connectivity.  

## Key Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- **IP Addresses:** IPv4 vs IPv6, format, and assignment  
- **CIDR Notation:** Defining network size and simplifying routing  
- **Subnetting:** Calculating network ranges, broadcast addresses, and usable hosts  
- **Private vs Public Networks:** When and why to use each  
- **Ports:** Common ports (22, 80, 443) and their role in communication  
- **Protocols:** Basics of TCP and UDP  
- **DNS Basics:** Mapping domain names to IP addresses  
- **Firewalls & Security Groups:** Controlling access to services  

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| Calculating subnet ranges manually | Practiced step-by-step CIDR and subnet calculations |
| Confusion between private and public IP usage | Visualized network topology and routing |
| Remembering common ports | Created a reference chart for quick lookup |
| Understanding protocols (TCP vs UDP) | Studied examples of real service communication |

## Key Takeaways

- Networking is **foundational for all DevOps tasks**, including cloud deployments and service connectivity.  
- Practical understanding of IPs, subnets, and ports **enables effective infrastructure design and troubleshooting**.  
- Exercises like subnetting and port checks **build confidence for production-level deployments**.  

## Real-World Applications

- Configuring cloud instances and VPCs  
- Setting up firewalls and security groups  
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues between services  
- Designing scalable, segmented networks for applications  
- Understanding service exposure and load balancer configuration  

## Learning Resources

- Official CIDR and subnetting guides  
- Networking tutorials for DevOps engineers  
- TCP/IP and common port references
